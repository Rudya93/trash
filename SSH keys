 this solution is not safe for case of stolen notebook or for machines you don't own.

You may copy your private keys from H1 to H2, if you want to use the same private key to be able to login from H2 to S1. When you at H1 do the commands:
H1$ ssh H2 mkdir ~/.ssh
H1$ scp  ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_dsa H2:~/.ssh/
